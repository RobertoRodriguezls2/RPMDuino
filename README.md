# RPMDuino
An RPM shift light for your car. This is a repository for one of my personal projects. This project uses an ESP32 board with a ELM-327 obd2 scanner and a ws2812 led strip. This was originally done running on the ESP32 like a normal arduino sketch but was later converted to use both cores on the ESP32 to multitask.
